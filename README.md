# efficiencyOfCountDiffVall
count actions and check the efficiency of 7 different algorithm for counting how much different value in given array

 algorithm been checks:
 1. special algorithm made for this task only
 2. algorithm that use insertion sort
 3. algorithm that use quick sort
 4. algorithm that use counting sort
 5. algorithm that use hash-table
 6. algorithm that use binary tree search
 7. algorithm that use red-black tree
 
 the well known part of some algorithm was taking from famous sites and edited for use as check diffrent value algorithm, so thanks that was lot longer if i was build everything from scratch.
